1. The user first lands on the homepage of the web app. On this landing page, there are two primary options: "Signup" and "Login." Signup is only meant for company owners (referred to as Superusers). When a Superuser signs up, they provide their organization name, email, and password. Upon successful signup, a new organization is created in the database, and a Superuser account is generated with the role set as "superuser", linked to that specific organization_id. After this, the Superuser is redirected to the Superuser Dashboard.

2. The Login feature allows any type of user — Superuser, Admin, or User — to access their account. Upon logging in, the system checks the user’s role and redirects them accordingly. If the role is Superuser, they are taken to the Superuser Dashboard. If the role is Admin, they are taken to the Admin Dashboard. If the role is User, they are taken to the User Dashboard.

3. In the Superuser Dashboard, the company owner (boss) has full control over their organization’s environment. The Superuser can view all activity across the organization, including both Admins and Users. They can create new Admins by assigning them the "admin" role, and they can also create Users. Additionally, the Superuser can manage the organization’s subscription, including upgrading to the Pro Plan, which enables video tracking. The Superuser is not tracked by the system — no screenshots, no activity data, and no videos are ever collected for Superusers.

4. In the Admin Dashboard, Admins are tracked just like regular users. Admins can view their own activity data and also view the activity of all Users in their organization. They can add, edit, or delete User accounts under the same organization. Admins are also allowed to delete their own sessions and screenshots as well as those belonging to their Users. However, Admins cannot access or manage the subscription plan, and they cannot see or edit the Superuser's data.

5. The User Dashboard is limited in permissions. Regular users are tracked by the system and can view only their own data, such as screenshots, sessions, productivity metrics, and usage history. Users are allowed to delete their own screenshots and sessions if needed. However, they cannot manage other accounts or see the activity of anyone else in the system.

6. The Desktop App is installed on the machines of Admins and Users (but never on Superuser devices). Once launched, the app authenticates with the Web Server via API. After authentication, tracking begins automatically. The app captures screenshots at regular intervals, monitors website and app usage, tracks keyboard and mouse activity, and logs session start and end times. If the organization is subscribed to the Pro Plan, the Desktop App also records the screen video. All tracking data is securely sent to the Web App backend through API calls.

7. The Web App backend receives incoming data from the Desktop App. It verifies the authentication token of each request and then processes and stores the data into MongoDB. Depending on the data type, it is saved under the appropriate collection — activities, screenshots, sessions, or videos (if the Pro Plan is enabled). The system ensures that all data is filtered and stored based on the user’s organization_id, keeping every company’s data isolated from others.

8. The MongoDB structure is organized to reflect this multi-tenant system. The "organizations" collection stores each company’s metadata, including its plan status. The "users" collection stores all users (Superusers, Admins, and Users) along with their roles and linked organization_id. Activities, screenshots, and sessions are stored with metadata such as user_id, organization_id, and timestamps. If the Pro Plan is active, videos are also stored in a separate "videos" collection. A "deletion_logs" collection is maintained to log all screenshot/session deletions for audit purposes.

9. In terms of deletion, Admins can delete their own sessions and screenshots as well as those of their Users. Regular Users can delete only their own data. When a session or screenshot is deleted, it is permanently removed from the database and storage, and the productivity report reflects that time as missing or removed. Deletion affects the accuracy of the time logs and dashboards and should be done carefully. The system displays a confirmation warning before finalizing the deletion.

10. The subscription flow is managed by the Superuser only. When the Superuser purchases the Pro Plan, it activates video tracking across the entire organization. The Desktop App will then start capturing and uploading screen recordings from all Admins and Users under that organization. These video files are stored locally or on a cloud server depending on the setup, and tagged with relevant metadata such as session ID, user ID, and organization ID.

11. Finally, the data access rules are strictly enforced. Each organization’s data is completely isolated using the organization_id. The Superuser has full visibility over all data in their organization, but they themselves are never tracked. Admins can view the data of Users under the same organization but cannot see or edit Superuser data. Users can only access their own information. No cross-organization data access is possible under any role.
